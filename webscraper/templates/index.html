                <p>This application is designed to scrape data from Ceneo. It works by sending HTTP requests to specific
                    URLs and then parsing the response to extract the required information.</p>

        <h2>How the App Works</h2>
        <p>Web Scraper works in three steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sending an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage you want to access. The server responds to the request
                by returning the HTML content of the webpage.</li>
            <li>Once the webpage content is accessed, the next step is to parse the data. Parsing is the process of
                extracting data from a webpage by breaking down its HTML structure.</li>
            <li>After the data is parsed, it is then stored in our database or you can download it as a CSV, JSON or
                Excel file.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>About the Libraries Used</h2>
    <p>We use a variety of libraries to make this app work. Some of the main ones include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flask: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework that provides tools, libraries, and technologies to
            build web applications. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up
            to complex applications.</li>
        <li>BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting the data.</li>
        <li>Chart.js: A powerful, flexible, open-source charting library for JavaScript. It allows developers to create
            interactive charts in different formats like line, bar, pie, etc., with ease.</li>
    </ul>
